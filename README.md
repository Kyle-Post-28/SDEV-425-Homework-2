# SDEV-425-Homework-2
This assignment provided me with a source code that is riddled with security issues. This assignment uses a simple JavaFX login application. The goal of the assignment is to mitigate any security flaws that may be present by implementing security controls, testing those controls, and documenting the results. Some of the security controls necessary are:  
* AC-7 - UNSUCCESSFUL LOGON ATTEMPTS 
* AC-8 - SYSTEM USE NOTIFICATION 
* AU-3 - CONTENT OF AUDIT RECORDS 
* AU-8 - TIME STAMPS 
* IA-2(1) IDENTIFICATION AND AUTHENTICATION (ORGANIZATIONAL USERS) | NETWORK ACCESS TO PRIVILEGED ACCOUNTS  
In addition to the code I have screen captured and documented everything in a MS word file. Enjoy!
